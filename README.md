# cs0320 Term Project

**Team Members:**
Rohan Jha, Jacob Leiken, Sean Hastings, McKenna Cisler

**Project Idea:**
A multiplayer, graphical implementation of the _Wikipedia game_ where the players
click on links to navigate from a _starting page_ to an _ending page_ on Wikipedia.

## Project Requirements
### Pre-game

The users can create and join games.
<br>_Rationale_:

A page with advanced settings for the game. _Ex: difficulty, sound,
etc._
<br>_Rationale_:

The users are presented the _starting_ page's title and the _ending_ page's title.
The interface does not necessarily have the text of the pages themselves, but
it does have visible links.
<br>_Rationale_:

### In-game

A user-interface that graphically represents a Wikipedia page and its outgoing
links. The interface does not necessarily have the text of the page itself, but
it does have a visible link.
<br>_Rationale_:

The users can easily move from one page to another. _Ex: visualize the
pages as towns and the links as roads._
<br>_Rationale_:

The users can track their progress and the progress of their opponents.
<br>_Rationale_:

The users can end the game midway.
<br>_Rationale_:

### Post-game

A page where the players' results are presented. This includes the players'
histories and a clear indication of the winner.
<br>_Rationale_:

The users are presented with the shortest path from the _starting_ page to the
_ending_ page.
<br>_Rationale_:

The users can navigate to a page where new games can be joined or created.
<br>_Rationale_:

### Extra features
- Single-player and multiplayer modes.

- Exclusion of certain articles.

- Game modes with different levels of difficulty.

- In-game music.

- The users can see the path of the other users if it overlaps with their path.

- The users can save different configurations.

- The users can see the distance to the _ending_ page.

- Some visualization of the Wikipedia graph and the search algorithms (not clearly defined) (in-game).

- A visualization of the paths that were taken and the shortest paths (post-game).

- A statistical analysis of a player's saved games to analyze their decision-making and word/concept associations.

- A change in the graphical representation of a webpage based on the subject and/or length and/or
distance of the page.

## Still left to define

- What's the lobby system?

- When does the game end?

- How are winners determined?
