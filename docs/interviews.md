## Interviews

#### Questions:

Present the idea to the interviewee.

What would be the easiest way to join and create games?

How would you want to see your progress?

How would you want to see the other players' progress?

What information would you want to see after the game was over?

Anything else?

#### Interview 1 (Jordan Schuster):

No public lobby. Random match. Facebook friends. Words with friends. Turns?


How far I've gone but not how far I have to go.

Easy: you can go back, difficult: you cannot go back.

Might be overwhelming to see other players' progress.

Fastest route, history, click on history to learn some fun stuff. Interesting stats. Clicks per second. Longest article clicked and shortest article clicked.

Might be overwhelming for the routes to be scattered and unorganized.

#### Interview 2 (Andrew Gord):

Easy to find way to start game.

Some indication of how far from the end. Nice graphics.

Definitely want to know where they are. In front or behind.

How long was the path relative to the fastest and the slowest. Length of time. A compliment.

Customizability. Pick between spaceships.
