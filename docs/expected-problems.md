## Expected Problems

#### Backend
- Efficient storage and traversal of Wikipedia articles
- Websocket clogging

#### Frontend
- Quickly parsing and neatly rendering the HTML for a Wikipedia page
- Adding graphics (HTML Canvas, other tools?)
- Making everything look really pretty (top-bar, logo, etc.)
  - Such that regular people (not just our friends and relatives) actually want to use it
- Dealing with the resizing of the screen
  - Dealing with mobile users
