## Testing

#### Jacob:
 - Manually clicking every single button on each page
 - Since my Javascript is all visual, testing will have to be consistently done by humans
 - Testing window resizing is also going to be a major focus
   - Especially including the canvases
 - Once mobile viewports are added, Chrome Dev Tools can be used

#### McKenna:
##### Wikipedia Parsing:
  - Testing link extraction (large-scale test over many wiki pages)
  - Testing body parsing
  - Testing of various link filters on basic inputs
  - Database storage / extraction

#### Sean:

#### Rohan:
- Going through standard gameplay with different tabs and computers
  - Navigating through different pages
  - Tracking player history
  - Viewing game details (number of links and timer)
  - Clean end to the gameplay
- Also testing the following edge cases
  - *Lots* of users
  - Starting on the destination page
  - Ending up at "blackholes"
  - Ending at the same time?
  - Destination page being unreachable?
